This project uses RSpec to write and manage test cases.
Tests are written to validate the user authentication (login and signup).

Test cases are present for both signup and login in spec/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb

Written test cases for both positive and negative scenarios

To run the test cases for all files bundle exec rspec

To run specific file bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb


Written test cases only based on this we can implement functionality
